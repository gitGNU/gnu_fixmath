Please try and keep the source consistent in style for easy
reading and management.

C-code
======

When writing or editing code, see the surrounding code
and other files for formatting style.  Some known
inconsistencies:

- Regarding whitespace and vertically aligned code features:
if you can keep the vertical alignment without changing lines
other than the one where the actual non-whitespace code change
is, please do.  Otherwise, whatever helps reading, but no
whitespace-only changes on any line.

- Full stop "." at the end of sentences in comments is
encouraged, and required for multiple sentences in a comment.

- There's also inconsistency regarding spacing and operators in
parentheses.  Use one spaces before and after any binary
operator and none before parentheses: '((a + b * d) / c)'.

- Regarding symbols, the exported API functions (and constants)
and nothing else, must have the fx_ prefix.


Shell code
==========

Only use portable Bourne shell constructs and commands.
See the "Portable Shell" section in the autoconf info pages.

- Use "test" rather than "[" ... "]" to keep a nominal common
style with scripts as well as configure.ac where using "["
... "]" is awkward.

- For autoconf-specific issues, see AC_RULES comment in configure.ac.

- Use ${varname} everywhere, not $varname.  No reason other than
the amount in the original files.

- Don't over-quote: do it only for ${srcdir}, ${objdir} and
similar or other expressions and variables that *may* be empty
or contain spaces: 'test "${srcdir}" = ..'.

- For constant strings and convenience variables that are always
set by the script itself to constant strings, for example to no
or yes, don't quote them: 'test ${myvar} = yes'.

- Where you have full control of the contents, don't use empty
variables.  Set and test for yes and no rather than emptiness.

- Regarding whitespace for vertical alignment, see above for C
code.


Makefiles
=========

- Only use portable make constructs as per the "Portable Make"
section in the autoconf info pages, with the addition of
one-level nested variable expansion: $(FOO_$(BAR)).

- Regarding whitespace for vertical alignment, see above for C
code and shell code.


Testing
=======

- New code and bug-fixes must always be accompanied by a
test-case, which fails or does not compile before the code
change, and passes after the change.

- Use "make many-distchecks" after any changes to configure.ac
or Makefile.am or one of the scripts.  Feel free to run
"make release-distchecks" too, but that may take a day or two.

- When changing any of the tuning or benchmarking scripts, also
do a cross-build with --disable-tune-cache as well as a build
with --disable-tune-cache and make check for a non-Linux system
for example as Solaris or NetBSD.
